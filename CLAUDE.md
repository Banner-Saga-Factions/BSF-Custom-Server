# BSF Project Root Guide

## Repository Structure

- **Backend:** `./bsf-server` (Node.js/TypeScript)
- **Frontend:** `./bsf-client` (ActionScript/AIR)

## Coordination Protocol

1. **Verify Boundaries:** Before changing a server endpoint, search `bsf-client/src/` for the matching `URLLoader` or `URLRequest` to ensure the data structures match.
2. **Context Switching:** When focusing on a specific repo, use the internal `CLAUDE.md` within that directory for specific build/test commands.
3. **Database Truth:** The SQLite schema in `bsf-server/src/db/schema.sql` is the source of truth for all persistent data shared between client and server.

## Shell & Command Output

- The user's default shell is **PowerShell** (Windows). When suggesting commands for the user to run, write them in PowerShell-friendly form (e.g. `;` for sequencing instead of `&&`, `$env:VAR=...` for env vars).
- For long-running or verbose local-dev commands — `yarn build`, `yarn test`, `yarn dev`, `start-server.bat`, `yarn test:coverage` — **prompt the user to run them locally** and paste back relevant output, rather than invoking them via the Bash/PowerShell tool. This avoids loading multi-thousand-line compiler/test output into the conversation context.
- Continue running short, low-output commands directly: `sqlite3` queries, `git status`/`git log`, file edits, single-file `Read`/`Grep`, etc.
