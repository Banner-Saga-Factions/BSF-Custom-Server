    /*
    looking at old session data I had two games with the same battle id? is it made from a hash of player ids or something?
    so if the same two players fight they get the same id? but that seems kinda dumb? 
    another thing is this was the battle id that appeared twice `17e2a8b2c20:47bda:53ceb` in one of the games my session id 
    started with `47bda` so I thought maybe its {some random hash}:{session_id1[0:4]}:{session_id2[0:4]} but after seeing 
    the id twice im not so sure
