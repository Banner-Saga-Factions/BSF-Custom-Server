# Data Structures

There are soooo many different data structures, so this will be WIP for a long long time.
This is how the data is structured when sent between the client and server, although the internal client and server representation can be different. You can get an idea of how the server structures the data by looking at the source code with a [flash decompiler](../README.md#data-sources)

---
## `party`:
 - `ids`: `Array<string>` An array of strings containing battle unit ids.
 
 e.g.
 ```JSON
 "party": {
    "ids": [
        "raider_start_0",
        "thrasher_start_0",
        "archer_start_0",
        "shieldbanger_start_0",
        "warrior_exp_0",
        "archer_start_1"
    ]
}
```
---
## `tiles`
An array of JSON objects, each with an x and y field denoting a units position on the board
- `class`: `tbs.srv.battle.data.Tile` Indicates data type
- `x`: `int` indicates units x position on board
- `y`: `int` indicates units y position on board

---
## `PurchasableUnitData`:
- `class`: `tbs.srv.data.PurchasableUnitsData` Indicates Data Type
- `id`: `string` Really not sure here. In my sample data it's always `global`, so maybe it indicates the availability of the units? i.e. global means available to all players? **To be investigated**
- `units`:  `Array<JSON>` Array of PurchasableUnit JSON objects
  - `class`: `tbs.srv.data.PurchasableUnitData` Indicates Data Type
  - `cost`: `int` Unit purchase cost in renwon
  - `def`: `JSON` EntityDef JSON object describing the unit [see EnitityDef](#entitydef)
  - `limit`: `int` Indicates how many times the unit can be purchased

e.g.
```JSON
"purchasable_units": {
    "class": "tbs.srv.data.PurchasableUnitsData",
    "units": [{
        "class": "tbs.srv.data.PurchasableUnitData",
        "def": {
            "class": "tbs.srv.data.EntityDef",
            "id": "archer",
            "entityClass": "archer",
            "autoLevel": 1.0,
            "stats": [
                ...
            ],
            "start_date": 0,
            "appearance_acquires": 0,
            "appearance_index": 0
        },
        "limit": 0,
        "cost": 10
    },
    ...
    ],
    "id": "global"
}
```
---
## `EntityDef`:
- `class`: `tbs.srv.data.EntityDef` Indicates data type
- `id`: `thrasher_start_0` The id of the unit
- `entityClass`: `thrasher` The class/type of unit
- `stats`: `Array<JSON>` Array of stat types defining the units stats
    - `class`: `tbs.srv.data.Stat`Indicates data type
    - `stat`: `string `String indicating the stat category the value corresponds to. One of [`RANK`, `RANGE`, `EXERTION`, `ABILITY_0`, `WILLPOWER`, `MOVEMENT`, `ARMOR_BREAK`, `STRENGTH`, `ARMOR`]
    - `value`: `int` The value of the given stat
- `start_date`: `int` Epoch timestamp of the date the unit was first added to the players roster,
- `appearance_acquires`: `int` No idea what this does. **To be investigated**
- `appearance_index`: `int` No idea what this does. **To be investigated**

e.g.
```JSON

"defs": [{
    "class": "tbs.srv.data.EntityDef",
    "id": "thrasher_start_0",
    "entityClass": "thrasher",
    "stats": [
        {

            "stat": "RANK",
            "value": 2
        },
        {
            "class": "tbs.srv.data.Stat",
            "stat": "RANGE",
            "value": 1

```

## `BattlePartyData`:
- `class`: `tbs.srv.battle.data.BattlePartyData` Indicates data type
- `user`: `int` User id for the relevant party
- `team`: `string` String of the user id. I think the functionality for the team name was never fully implemented and so this field is unused.
- `display_name`: `string` String indicating the users display name
- `defs` : `Array<EntityDef>` An array of [EntityDefs](#entitydef), defining the parties units
- `match_handle`: The match handle for the users current battle
- `party_index`: `int` I've only seen this as either 1 or 0 so I think it indicates which party is first or second to move, although I'm not 100% sure. **To be investigated**
- `elo`: `int` The users elo rating. 0 for quick play, not sure if its set for tournament play. **To be investigated**
- `power`: `int` The power level of the users party
- `session_key`: `int` Really no idea what this is since it doesnt match with the users session key in the requests. Although maybe its the session key encoded as an `int` since normally the session key is a hex string in the requests? but the number seems a little bit small. **To be investigated**
- `battle_count`: `int` The number of battles played by a user
- `timer`: `int` The time in seconds the user has per turn (Thanks Stef! ðŸ™‚).
- `tourney_id`: `int` Tournament id; `0` for quick play. Not sure if data changes if it is a tournament.  **To be investigated**

- `user_id`: `int` User id of the user who has posted it's sync data

- `ordinal`: `int` Number between 0 and 2, seems to increment for each request in a single turn and reset on next turn. **To be investigated** 
- `hash`: `int` The server and both clients generate a hash. The server sends sync data to both clients which then verifies the hash matches theirs. The hash is a DJB hash on the hash string which is composed of game data. More info [here](https://github.com/Pieloaf/BSF-Custom-Server/issues/2).
- `team`: `string` String of the user id. I think the functionality for the team name was never fully implemented and so this field is unused.
- `hash_str`: `string` Seems to always be null in the sent data, but is used to generate the hash itself. See [here](https://github.com/Pieloaf/BSF-Custom-Server/issues/2#issuecomment-1321164727) for more.
